# Coding Exercise
Fork this repository and create a single page application using [React](https://reactjs.org) (and any other technologies) that allows users to browse, sort, and filter data from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/).  What this looks like and how it functions is largely open ended.  Implement as much as time permits with the goal of demonstrating broad and/or deep proficiency.

In rough order of importance, here are a few things that are interesting:
* application functions and actually allows user to browse, sort, and filter at least a subset of the API
* code quality & productivity
* fluency in react
* adding in a server component:
  * using [node](https://nodejs.org/), storage can just be in-memory
  * users can "favorite" objects and retrieve from the server later
  * comments on objects
  * *real-time* comments on objects
  * etc
* the app is not ugly

Assume users will not login and should provide their own names etc if relevant. Getting caught up in authentication is **not** interesting.  Please provide instructions for running the project in your README if `npm start` is not sufficient.
